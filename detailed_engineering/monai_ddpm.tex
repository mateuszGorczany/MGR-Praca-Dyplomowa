The first attempt to generate artificial scans was based on the variant autoencoder architecture proposed in \cite{rombach2022high}. The implementation was based on the Monai\cite{Cardoso_MONAI_An_open-source_2022} example available on Github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Project-MONAI/GenerativeModels/blob/e7cc989cdce440a7bff1cce22fff1caf760f39cd/tutorials/generative/3d_autoencoderkl/3d_autoencoderkl_tutorial.ipynb}} and adjusted to Pytorch Lightning.
