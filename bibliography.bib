abstract = {Recent advances in Deep Learning have largely benefited from larger and more diverse training sets. However, collecting large datasets for medical imaging is still a challenge due to privacy concerns and labeling costs. Data augmentation makes it possible to greatly expand the amount and variety of data available for training without actually collecting new samples. Data augmentation techniques range from simple yet surprisingly effective transformations such as cropping, padding, and flipping, to complex generative models. Depending on the nature of the input and the visual task, different data augmentation strategies are likely to perform differently. For this reason, it is conceivable that medical imaging requires specific augmentation strategies that generate plausible data samples and enable effective regularization of deep neural networks. Data augmentation can also be used to augment specific classes that are underrepresented in the training set, e.g., to generate artificial lesions. The goal of this systematic literature review is to investigate which data augmentation strategies are used in the medical domain and how they affect the performance of clinical tasks such as classification, segmentation, and lesion detection. To this end, a comprehensive analysis of more than 300 articles published in recent years (2018–2022) was conducted. The results highlight the effectiveness of data augmentation across organs, modalities, tasks, and dataset sizes, and suggest potential avenues for future research.}

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Previous studies have reported significant variation in prostate cancer rates and trends mainly due to differences in detection practices, availability  of treatment, and underlying genetic susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: To assess recent  worldwide prostate cancer incidence, mortality rates, and trends using up-to-date  incidence and mortality data. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We present estimated  age-standardized prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates by country and  world regions for 2018 based on the GLOBOCAN database. We also examined rates and  temporal trends for incidence (44 countries) and mortality (76 countries) based  on data series from population-based registries. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The highest  estimated incidence rates were found in Australia/New Zealand, Northern America,  Western and Northern Europe, and the Caribbean, and the lowest rates were found  in South-Central Asia, Northern Africa, and South-Eastern and Eastern Asia. The  highest estimated mortality rates were found in the Caribbean (Barbados, Trinidad  and Tobago, and Cuba), sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa), parts of former Soviet  Union (Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia), whereas the lowest rates were found in  Asia (Thailand and Turkmenistan). Prostate cancer incidence rates during the most  recent 5 yr declined (five countries) or stabilized (35 countries), after  increasing for many years; in contrast, rates continued to increase for four  countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. During the most recent 5 data years,  mortality rates among the 76 countries examined increased (three countries),  remained stable (59 countries), or decreased (14 countries). CONCLUSIONS: As  evident from available data, prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates have  been on the decline or have stabilized recently in many countries, with decreases  more pronounced in high-income countries. These trends may reflect a decline in  prostate-specific antigen testing (incidence) and improvements in treatment  (mortality). PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined recent trends in prostate cancer  incidence and mortality rates in 44 and 76 countries, respectively, and found  that rates in most countries stabilized or decreased.},
